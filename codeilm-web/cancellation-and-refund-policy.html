            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>At Codeilm, we strive to provide the best learning experience for our users. However, if you are not satisfied with our services or wish to request a refund, we have outlined our cancellation and refund policies below.</p>

            <h2>1. Cancellation Policy</h2>
            <p>You may cancel your subscription or course enrollment at any time. However, please note that cancellation does not guarantee a refund unless it meets the conditions stated in our refund policy.</p>

            <h2>2. Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>Refunds are only available under the following conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you cancel your subscription within 7 days of purchase and have not accessed more than 10% of the course content.</li>
                <li>Refund requests must be made within 7 days of the purchase date by contacting our support team at <strong>support@codeilm.com</strong>.</li>
                <li>Once your refund is approved, it will be processed within 7-10 business days and returned to the original payment method.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Non-refundable Situations</h2>
            <p>We do not provide refunds in the following cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When the user has accessed more than 10% of the course content.</li>
                <li>In case of late refund requests (i.e., beyond the 7-day refund period).</li>
                <li>If the course was purchased during promotional periods or at a discounted rate, unless specified otherwise.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Changes to the Policy</h2>
